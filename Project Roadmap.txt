CSE 331 Project Phase 2 Roadmap:

1) Implement the ticket system where each process is assigned tickets upon creation (in fork() ).

2) Implement the lottery scheduling logic in kernel/sched.c

3) Implement the ticket assingnment logic 

4) Add a system call "set_lottery_scheduler(bool enabled)" in which when it is called with the parameter "true", 
   it will switch to using the lottery scheduler. When it is called with "false", it should revert to default scheduling policy.
 
5) Make sure that when lottery scheduler is active, sched_setscheduler() system call is rendered ineffective 

6) Do test runs to test the code

7) Perform an analysis by running a CPU intensive program in both lottery scheduler and the default schedulers.

8) Write a report
